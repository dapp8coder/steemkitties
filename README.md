# CryptoKitties need to do more, explore, and go on adventures.

Posting to Steemit a Meow will allow for a background to be selected and payment to offer writers on Steemit Network, for a narrative.  

There will be a market place for designers to create and sell backgrounds, and "choose your own adventure" story lines sold by writers.
